# :baguette_bread: CiabattaBot

CiabattaBot is a simple open-source Discord bot made in Java using [Java Discord API (JDA)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer).
The bot provides various features that range from server moderation to playing music.

## How to run

To run CiabattaBot, you have to set some values in the `src/main/resources/config/ConfigurationKeys.properties` file.

```properties
# Required
DiscordToken=<discord-bot-token>     # The secret token from the Discord Developer Portal

# Optional
TranslatorKeyFile=translatorKey.json # The location of the .json file generated by Google (for translation functionality)
OwnerId=<your-id>                    # Your Discord ID (for shutdown command)
```

After all properties are set, just use the Gradle Wrapper to start the application.

```bash
./gradlew run
```
